# KCD Community Meetups

Meetups are voice/video chats hosted and managed on the
[KCD Community on Discord](/discord).

**KCD Community Meetups help develop friendships within the community to make
the world a more pleasant place to be for all of us.**

When a host starts a meetup, anyone can join to listen in or join in the
discussion. A meetup could be around a specific topic or just an informal
get-together. You could play a game together, collaborate on a solution to a
problem, practice a talk, discuss a book or movie, give a demo of your work,
chat about world events, or really whatever else you want to do (provided you
follow [the code of conduct](/conduct)).

## So, what is it?

It's conceptually similar to [clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/):

- You can follow other users to be notified when they start a meetup
- You can schedule a meetup at a specific time (one-time or recurring) and folks
  can opt-into getting notified when you start
- You can start an impromptu meetup

Everything works within Discord via the KCD Discord bot and the `?meetup`
command. By default, when your meetup starts, the bot will create a voice
channel for you and everyone to join (the channel will be deleted when it's
empty but no sooner than 15 minutes after it's created). If you want, you can
use Zoom instead by including a zoom link in your meetup details (if you want
the meetup recorded, this is the recommended approach).

## So, how do I use it?

Once you've [joined the KCD Community on Discord](/discord), then go to the
[`#ü§ñ-talk-to-bots`](https://kcd.im/discord-talk-to-bots) channel and type:

```
?meetup help
```

This will list the available commands you can run. Like this:

### Following other people

All meetup-related stuff happens in the `MEETUPS` channel category. In there,
you'll find a `#‚û°Ô∏è-follow-me` channel where you'll see everyone who hosts
meetups. You can follow them by adding an emoji reaction of `‚úã` to their
message.

When you follow someone, you will be notified in the `#üîî-meetup-notifications`
channel any time they start a meetup.

### Getting followers

To add your own message to the `#‚û°Ô∏è-follow-me` channel, think of a good bio to
describe yourself and the kind of meetups you plan to host. Then go to
`#ü§ñ-talk-to-bots` and use the `?meetup follow-me` command. Here's an example:

```
?meetup follow-me Put your bio here
```

Then you'll get a message in the `#‚û°Ô∏è-follow-me` channel and people can start
following you.

If you'd like to update your bio, simply run the command again until you're
happy with it.

If you'd like to remove your follow me message, add the `‚ùå` reaction to it and
the bot will delete it. You can always recreate it, but **KEEP IN MIND** this is
a destructive operation and when you do this you will lose all your followers.

### Starting a meetup

Anyone can start a meetup at any time. To start a meetup, go to
`#ü§ñ-talk-to-bots` and use the `?meetup start` command. Here's an example:

```
?meetup start Title of your meetup
```

This will create a voice channel for the meetup and notify all your followers.

If you'd like to use zoom instead of a discord voice channel, simply include the
zoom link at the end of the command:

```
?meetup start Title of your meetup https://zoom.us/j/761555341
```

Keep in mind that if you do not have a paid Zoom account, your meetup will be
limited to 40 minutes if you have more than two people in your meetup.

### Scheduled meetups

You can find all the scheduled meetups in the `#‚è±-upcoming-meetups` channel. If
one of them looks interesting to you, then add an emoji reaction of `‚úã` and
you'll be notified in the `#üîî-meetup-notifications` channel when the host
starts that meetup. If you'd no longer like to be notified of that meetup, then
you can remove your emoji reaction.

> Tip: if you're following that host, then you don't need to bother because
> you'll be notified of every meetup they start anyway.

### Scheduling a meetup

If you have a meetup you would like to plan in advance, you can add it to the
schedule in `#‚è±-upcoming-meetups` for people to opt-into being notified and plan
for. To schedule a meetup, go to `#ü§ñ-talk-to-bots` and use the
`?meetup schedule` command. Here's an example:

```
?meetup schedule "The Subject of the Meetup" and some more details about the meetup go here

You can also use multiple lines
Make sure to include the day and time (and timezone). An everytimezone.com link could be helpful.
Include a zoom link if you'd like to run it through zoom instead of discord
```

This will add your meetup to the schedule and it will notify all your followers
in `#üîî-meetup-notifications` that you've scheduled a meetup (so they can plan
for it).

### Starting a scheduled meetup

When you're ready for your scheduled meetup to start, go to the
`#‚è±-upcoming-meetups`, find the message for your meetup, and add a `üèÅ` emoji
reaction to it. This will create a voice channel (if necessary), notify all your
followers and those who opted-into notifications for the scheduled meetup, and
delete the scheduled meetup message (read more about recurring meetups below).

### Canceling a scheduled meetup

If you'd like to cancel a scheduled meetup, locate it's message in the
`#‚è±-upcoming-meetups` channel and add one of the following emoji as a reaction
to it:

- `‚ùå` if you want to cancel and notify your followers (and those who opted-into
  notifications for it) that it was canceled.
- `üõë` if you want to cancel and NOT notify anyone it was canceled.

When it's canceled, the bot will delete the message. You can schedule more
meetups if you'd like, but **KEEP IN MIND** that canceling a meetup is a
destructive operation and you will lose all opt-ins (`‚úã` reactions) when you do
this.

### Updating a scheduled meetup

If you'd like to update an existing scheduled meetup, go to `#ü§ñ-talk-to-bots`
and use the `?meetup schedule update` command. You need to provide a link to the
scheduled message (long-press on the message or click the three dots next to it
and click "Copy Message Link"). Here's an example:

```
?meetup update https://discord.com/channels/715220730605731931/801954718984175657/812228747973230622 "Updated Subject" and any additional details

Don't forget to put the day/time/timezone if it's for a specific time!
```

This will update the scheduled meetup message.

### Scheduling a recurring meetup

By default, once a scheduled meetup has been started, it's removed from the
schedule. If you'd like the meetup to happen regularly, then you might want to
make it a recurring meetup. To do this, simply add the word "recurring" before
your meetup subject. For example:

```
?meetup schedule recurring "The Subject of the Meetup" and some more details
```

This does everything a regular scheduled meetup does except instead of deleting
the message when you start the meetup (by adding the `üèÅ` to the message), the
message will remain and the bot just removes the `üèÅ` so you can start it again
another time.

## Where do we send links/text etc.?

Anywhere you'd like. You can use the `#üí¨-meetup-general-chat` to drop links
during your meetup if you'd like. If you're on Zoom, you can use the built-in
chat in Zoom. Or, if you plan to make heavy use of text-based chat for your
meetups, then you can request a text chat channel be made. Bring it up in
`#üí¨-meetup-general-chat` and we'll get you set up.

## Conclusion

We really hope that you enjoy using Meetups to connect more with people and
develop lasting relationships with people.
